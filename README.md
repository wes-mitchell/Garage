## Practice: Custom Colors and Sounds

1. Move all common properties in your vehicles to a new **`Vehicle`** class.
1. Create an instance of each vehicle.
1. Define a different value for each vehicle's properties.
1. Create a `Drive()` method in the **`Vehicle`** class.
1. Override the `Drive()` method in all the other vehicle classes. Include the vehicle's color in the message _(i.e. "The blue Ram drives past. RRrrrrrummbbble!")_.

1. Create a `Turn(string direction)` mathod, and a `Stop()` method on **`Vehicle`**. Define a basic implementation of each.
1. Override all three of those methods on some of the vehicles. For example, the `Stop()` method for a plane would be to output the message _"The white Cessna rolls to a stop after rolling a mile down the runway."_
1. Make your vehicle instances perform all three behaviors.
